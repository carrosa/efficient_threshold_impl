Note: This implementation can only be compiled for and run on CPUs that support the AVX512 instruction set.

This repository contains our implementation of the Labrador proof system together with implementations of the Chihuahua, Dachshund and Greyhound front ends.

To compile a test program for Greyhound and Labrador, run `make test_greyhound'. This produces the executable test_greyhound, which tests and benchmarks the Greyhound front end followed by several iterations of Labrador. More concretely, the program generates a uniformly random polynomial of length 2^26, commits to it, produces an evaluation proof, and checks that the proof verifies correctly.

To compile a shared library containing all the dogs, run `make libdogs.so'. See the header files for the api.
