# Benchmarking Olingo

## Passive security scheme:

We build upon dilithiums codebase using GMP for larger integers.

## LIN proofs:

We adapt https://github.com/dfaranha/lattice-verifiable-mixnet for BDLOP commitments and linear proofs. See its readme for more info on how to build.

## LNP proofs with lazer:

We use the python interface for Lazer for LNP style proofs.
The folders for our benchmarks:

* python/bnd_E_prf
* python/dkg_prf1
* python/sign_prf
